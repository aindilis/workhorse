    Angoss’s Text Analytics software KnowledgeREADER has the lexalytics engine
    embedded inside of the tool. Angoss has the best Decision & Strategy trees
    on the market and its visualization features enhance its ability to compete
    with all the top 10 players here and is gaining a lot of attraction in the
    market.

    I think Angoss should definitely be in the top 10.

    places, things) and even connections (e.g. how one feels about a particular
    brand in a social media post).

    The broken link to DiscoverText is to an outdated marketing page. The home
    page is <a href="https://www.discovertext.com/&quot; title="DiscoverText".
    A longer description is "DiscoverText is a cloud-based, collaborative text
    analytics solution. Generate valuable insights about customers, products,
    employees, news, citizens, and more. With dozens of powerful text mining
    features, the DiscoverText software solution provides tools to quickly and

    I bumped (again, actually) into this old post. Always happy to see that my
    company, Expert System, is listed.
    I remember when this was a niche and we were part of a very small group of
    companies working in this field, now there are hundreds of us :-) Actually,
    most of the old players are gone, turns out that it’s no easy task to build
    great technology and, at the same time, find a way to make money with it.
    Truth is, this industry is still very young and users don’t really know
    what to expect from text mining software or how to compare different
    services, so the past isn’t necessarily a testament to any company’s
    technical or business skills, nor is it a way to foresee the future.
    Probably we just have to wait for the market to “grow up”, hopefully
    helping it in doing so with modern approaches and new business models (we
    just launched our open beta at developer.cogitoapi.com since, you know,
    APIs is what the cool kids do these days and, most of all, you want to give
    free access to your stuff so that people can assess your real value).
    If I had to leave a suggestion, although merely subjective, for companies
    struggling in this business, I’d say that understanding that you work on a
    “solution” is the most important thing. Your technology must be good,
    naturally, and you’re going to do a lot of networking if you want to market
    your product, we all know this, but your actual weapon will be to have a
    real solution to a real problem. In other words: customer first, always.
