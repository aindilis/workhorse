Workhorse

System to read and understand books and other texts

Workhorse is a system to set up dedicated servers for the creation of
tagged, analyzed and understood texts, and other linguistic research.
For datasets, we have Wikipedia, Gutenberg, and hopefully fulltext
books from Google Books, all appropriately licensed.  We aim to
develop a highly annotated freely-available corpus of marked-up texts
that have been processed with a wide variety of state of the art
systems.  We also aim to apply natural language understanding,
knowledge base population, and other techniques, onto the texts to
derive useful knowledge.
